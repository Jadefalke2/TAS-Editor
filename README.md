A simple-to-use GUI for Nintendo Switch TAS editing.

# Usage
### important
This Program is still WIP and not done, remember this is an alpha version. There might be some undetected bugs that might even corrupt your script. While we tried to ensure that there is no such bug, I can't guarantee there isn't. Please back up any file that you plan on using with the editor. If you run into any bug please ping me in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/U7tUnkxkAT) @Jadefalke#3799 so we can fix this bug.
As of now it is **not** possible to change between files within the software, you'll have to restart it. Sorry for this inconvenience.
